### A Sprint Review (Demo) provides the platform for the Scrum Team to showcase what they accomplished during the sprint while creating the opportunity for key stakeholders to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog, if necessary.

Sprint demos are an opportunity to show tangible progress toward a product goal. When there are regular check-ins with stakeholders, the team can consistently deliver and demonstrate value with working, tested iterations.

When stakeholders are in the development loop, they can provide immediate feedback that the product is what they want. If not, correcting in smaller increments is more manageable than once the product is complete.

Sprint demos create fast feedback loops, regularly inspect and adapt the product backlog if necessary, and reduce costs and risks. Every sprint builds on the next and consistently delivers value when the development process is regularly inspected and adapted.
